# Webapp For Smart India Hackathon

A Flask website that acts as a repository of court cases and enables.
- Quick searching of cases based on keywords and topics.
- Adding new cases and assigning lawyers to those cases.
- Generate receipts for transactions.   

The website also creates summaries/gists of case documents generated using the [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html) pre trained transformer. Summaries allow the lawyers to get an understanding of what the case is about without reading the entire document.
